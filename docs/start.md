# Welcome to the Rapid Acceleration 2025 Docs!
These docs aim to describe all components of our codebase, as well as provide links to the documentation of the libraries and frameworks that this codebase uses. It was created in part using ChatGPT, so if you discover that any part of the documentation is incorrect, fix it if you can or open an issue.

* **WPILib**  ------- https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/index.html#
